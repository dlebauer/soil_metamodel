Development of a ‘super model’ approach: Application to soil carbon cycle models
==============

**Lead organizers:**

* Kiona Ogle (Arizona State University), 
* Jennifer Powers (University of Minnesota), 
* David LeBauer (University of Illinois)

## Workshop overview:

This workshop follows from discussions during the 2012 RCN FORECAST conference on “New perspectives on data assimilation in global change science.” At that meeting we recognized the need to integrate information from diverse methods that have been used to measure and model belowground processes. We proposed to build a ‘super model’ in which to combine different modeling approaches with heterogeneous data. 


### Expected Products and Outcomes: 

We are deliberately recruiting a diverse group with skills in modeling and/or empirical measurements of soil carbon, and we expect that participants could contribute to a number of different products including a conceptual or synthesis paper, model development and application, and/or the eventual submission of a grant proposal to further develop these activities.


## Next Steps

(see issues, milestones) 

1. Organize issues / milestones
2. Determine data conventions
3. Outline model 
4. Prepare minimal working example
5. Ask participants for data and models
6. Fill out README

## Data

TBD: see Issue 1: https://github.com/dlebauer/soil_metamodel/issues/1

## Software / Code

* SoilR
* STAN
* Manuscripts with reproducible analyses 
* New features in STAN, SoilR; new libraries / packages https://github.com/dlebauer/soil_metamodel/issues/6

# To participate

1. create a github account (https://github.com/join)
2. send username to David
3. edit anything you want by clicking the edit / pencil icon
4. fork and clone the repository

## Within Github

It is pretty easy to make edits directly (e.g. try attempting to edit one of the files here (e.g. [Introduction.md]( https://github.com/dlebauer/ecological-forecasting-workflows-draft/edit/master/Introduction.md#fullscreen_blob_contents) after you have an account). It should walk you through the steps of suggesting an edit via pull request.
